## Description
This full-stack PERM application functions as a visual project management tool using a Kanban board layout. It leverages JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication, allowing users to log in and manage project tickets organized into three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Completed. Users can create new tickets, update existing ones, or remove tickets. The app is deployed via Render and built using PostgreSQL for the database, with a tech stack that includes Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js.
